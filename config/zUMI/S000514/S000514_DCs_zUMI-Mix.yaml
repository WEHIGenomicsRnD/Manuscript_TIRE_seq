#Welcome to zUMIs
#below, please fill the mandatory inputs
#We expect full paths for all files.

#You can merge multiple samples and give the sample barcodes in a text file with -b option.
#You can separate them later from the count tables.

# Make sure to have a reference genome indexed with the same version of STAR
